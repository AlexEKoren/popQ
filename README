Welcome to the world of popQ! popQ was my first social application and also the first that I've put up on the Apple App Store. It's some pretty gross code.

popQ allows you take a quick picture, ask a question, and then send it off to friends who can answer "Yes" or "No." You receive the responses in real time and can keep track of which side is winning out.

popQ was more of a learning experience for me than anything. I wanted to go through the motions of iOS development, product and design execution, and the process of getting an application up on the App Store. There's definitely work to be done, but I'm currently prioritizing some of my other projects.
